TOOLS FOR TURKISH LEARNERS

This projects is a collection of scripts that are meant to make learning Turkish
more fun and more efficient by tapping into media sources and tools available in
abundance online.


PREREQUISITES

This is not a language course, meaning you will need to know already some basic
Turkish in order to make good use of the tools provided.

On the technical side, you will need a Ruby installation and install the
following gem(s)

* libarchive_ruby_swig
* nokogiri

In addition, you need to install TRMorph by Çağrı Çöltekin, available from

    http://www.let.rug.nl/coltekin/trmorph/

which in turn requires an installation of the Stuttgart Finite State Transducer
Tools available from

    http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/gramotron/SOFTWARE/SFST.html

You then have to put a shell script in your path that invokes TRMorph in the
following fashion

    #!/bin/sh
    exec fst-parse /usr/lib/trmorph/trmorph.a $*


TOOLKIT DESCRIPTION

1. The Subtitle Downloader

This tool is called 'vikisubex' and allows you to download the Turkish subtitles
for shows on Viki.com.

2. The Tokenizer

The 'tokenizer' simply splits an input text into a stream of tokens with all
punctuation removed. Each token is printed on a separate line. The tokenizer can
also sort tokens according to the Turkish Alphabet and remove duplicates.

3. The Morphological Analyzer

'morphalzye' is a wrapper around TRMorph, a very sophisticated morphological
analyzer developed by Çağrı Çöltekin. It takes as input the token list produced
by the tokenizer and for each token generates a list of possible words that may
be roots of the word that a token represents.

4. The Online Dictionary Interface

The 'dictlookup' tool is an interface to various online dictionaries and
translation services. It takes as input a list of words and returns a series of
translations including common phrases and compound expressions as provided by
the dictionary.
